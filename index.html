        <p>
        As a Research Assistant, I contributed to a multi-camera tracking system in collaboration with Lowe’s, where I developed scalable pipelines for object detection, tracking, and re-identification using vision-language models like CLIP. This work required advanced knowledge of data analysis, feature extraction, and optimization, ensuring high performance in real-world deployments.
         </p>
 <p>
     At Honeywell, I gained hands-on experience in embedded systems and IoT. I designed and implemented neural network-based systems to automate processes and optimize real-time IoT applications. I also collaborated with hardware teams to improve system performance, enhance firmware reliability, and streamline testing processes.
        </p>
         <p>
             I have worked on diverse projects, such as building a machine learning pipeline to estimate vehicle speeds using RNNs and Transformers, developing a brain tumor classification model using CNNs, and designing an age prediction system from voice data. In addition, I created an IoT-based smart home automation system integrating sensors and actuators with real-time monitoring dashboards and developed a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game on an MSP430 microcontroller, showcasing my expertise in hardware-software integration using UART and I2C protocols.
             </p>
         <p>
             My technical skills include Python, SQL, and machine learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, along with expertise in embedded systems and IoT technologies, such as MQTT protocols, microcontrollers, and real-time systems. I have a deep understanding of algorithms, predictive modeling, data preprocessing, and visualization.
              </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about contributing to meaningful projects that combine machine learning, data science, embedded systems, and IoT to drive innovation and deliver impactful solutions. My goal is to leverage my technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, and collaborative mindset to transform ideas into actionable results.

                    <p>This project develops a machine learning model to estimate vehicle speeds from video data using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer models. The approach involves extracting temporal features from video sequences, which are then fed into an advanced neural network architecture. The model is trained and validated on a labeled dataset of roadway videos, with each frame annotated with the corresponding vehicle speed. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in speed estimation, providing a robust tool for traffic monitoring and automated speed enforcement systems.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>Research Assistant, UNC Charlotte</h3>
            <p>As a Research Assistant at UNC Charlotte, I have been actively involved in cutting-edge research at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and real-world applications. My primary focus has been on the "Multi-Camera Object Tracking and Video Activity Analysis" project, developed in collaboration with Lowe's. In this project, I designed and implemented scalable pipelines for object detection, tracking, and activity analysis. This work involved integrating advanced models such as CLIP-ReID to enhance re-identification accuracy and deploying the system in real-world retail environments.

Additionally, my thesis, "Learning Deception and Counter-Deception Strategies in Adversarial Settings," explores multi-agent interactions in adversarial environments. Leveraging reinforcement learning and vision-language models, I developed frameworks for optimizing agent strategies in complex, dynamic scenarios. This research addresses critical challenges in decision-making, adaptive behavior, and resource optimization in adversarial contexts.</p>
        <h3>Embedded Software Engineer, Honeywell International </h3>
          <p>
              As an Embedded Software Engineer at Honeywell, I contributed to the design and development of real-time embedded systems, specializing in programming and testing software solutions in C++ for mission-critical applications. I ensured the systems were reliable, efficient, and optimized for performance under stringent requirements.

In addition, I developed Python automation scripts to streamline and optimize various manual tasks, significantly improving efficiency and reducing human error. These robust and scalable solutions utilized Python and its libraries to eliminate repetitive processes and enhance overall productivity.

I worked extensively with large datasets, preprocessing them for analysis and modeling. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, I extracted meaningful insights and derived valuable information from textual data. Additionally, I employed machine learning frameworks such as KNN, Random Forest, logistic regression, and TensorFlow to design, implement, and train predictive models.

One of my key achievements was the development of a text-to-speech (TTS) system using neural networks, which mimicked human voices to generate natural, high-quality audio output based on input text. This project involved deep learning models, voice synthesis libraries, and advanced TTS technologies to deliver a highly functional and innovative solution.

Through these experiences, I honed my skills in embedded software programming and testing in C++, Python automation, machine learning, NLP, and real-time system development, contributing to Honeywell’s focus on operational excellence and technological innovation.
