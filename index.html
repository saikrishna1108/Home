        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
 I am Sai Krishna Reddy Mareddy, a Master's student in Computer Engineering at UNC Charlotte, graduating in May 2025. My academic journey and professional experiences are centered on machine learning, data science, embedded systems, and IoT, with a strong passion for solving real-world problems through innovative technology.
         </p>
        <p>
        As a Research Assistant, I contributed to a multi-camera tracking system in collaboration with Loweâ€™s, where I developed scalable pipelines for object detection, tracking, and re-identification using vision-language models like CLIP. This work required advanced knowledge of data analysis, feature extraction, and optimization, ensuring high performance in real-world deployments.
         </p>
 <p>
     At Honeywell, I gained hands-on experience in embedded systems and IoT. I designed and implemented neural network-based systems to automate processes and optimize real-time IoT applications. I also collaborated with hardware teams to improve system performance, enhance firmware reliability, and streamline testing processes.
        </p>
         <p>
             I have worked on diverse projects, such as building a machine learning pipeline to estimate vehicle speeds using RNNs and Transformers, developing a brain tumor classification model using CNNs, and designing an age prediction system from voice data. In addition, I created an IoT-based smart home automation system integrating sensors and actuators with real-time monitoring dashboards and developed a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game on an MSP430 microcontroller, showcasing my expertise in hardware-software integration using UART and I2C protocols.
             </p>
         <p>
             My technical skills include Python, SQL, and machine learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, along with expertise in embedded systems and IoT technologies, such as MQTT protocols, microcontrollers, and real-time systems. I have a deep understanding of algorithms, predictive modeling, data preprocessing, and visualization.
              </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about contributing to meaningful projects that combine machine learning, data science, embedded systems, and IoT to drive innovation and deliver impactful solutions. My goal is to leverage my technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, and collaborative mindset to transform ideas into actionable results.

                    <strong>Two-Player Tic-Tac-Toe on MSP430 Microcontroller</strong>
                    <p>Built a two-player game on an MSP430 microcontroller, featuring hardware integration such as a custom PCB, LED indicators, a buzzer, and an LCD screen. The system utilized UART and I2C communication protocols to demonstrate embedded system design and inter-device communication.</p>

                    <p>This project develops a machine learning model to estimate vehicle speeds from video data using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer models. The approach involves extracting temporal features from video sequences, which are then fed into an advanced neural network architecture. The model is trained and validated on a labeled dataset of roadway videos, with each frame annotated with the corresponding vehicle speed. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in speed estimation, providing a robust tool for traffic monitoring and automated speed enforcement systems.</p>

                    <p> This research project delves into the realm of age group prediction through the analysis of voice data, utilizing a comprehensive set of audio features extracted from recordings. The objective is to discern age-related patterns within the extracted features, thereby enabling accurate age prediction. Two distinct methodologies, classical machine learning (ML) and neural networks, are explored to ascertain their effectiveness in this task.</p>
